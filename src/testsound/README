Must compile libmikmod first. Look in the DOS folder within it. 

Need to move libmikmod.a to .

Need the DOS extension driver too. 

You can put tracker files into a C header like this. 

xxd -i track.s3m > track_xm.h

Handy if you note the original format in the output filename for debugging. 

i386-pc-msdosdjgpp-gcc in.c libmikmod.a -o out.exe
i386-pc-strip out.exe
