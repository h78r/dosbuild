Installing LFN Services

Review config.nt supplied with the LFN Services and compare it with 
%SystemRoot%\system32\config.nt (usually c:\winnt\system32\config.nt) 
The relewant line to look for is NTCMDPROMT.
You can enable NTCMDPROMT if you want doskey (ie commandline history to work)
Once you're done with NTCMDPROMT in %SystemRoot%\system32\config.nt open a new 
DOS box (Start-> Programs-> CommandPrompt) switch to the directory where you
put lfnload.com and lfnsrv.dll and run lfnload. If everything went fine you
will receive a message saying that lfnsrv.dll has been loaded.
Alternatively you can call lfnload.com from autoexec.nt so that it loads
automatically on DOS box startup. The files lfnload.com and lfnsrv.dll must
reside in the same directory for the LFN Services to work properly.
